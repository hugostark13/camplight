# Test Task - User List Application

# Objective:

Develop an application that allows a user to view, add, and delete users
from a list.

The estimated time for this task is a maximum of 4 hours - when you reach it, letâ€™s have a call. 

The idea is to have a practical conversation about technological choices.

# Requirements:

## List Users:

- Display a list of users with their Name, Email, and Phone number.
- Implement pagination.
- Each user should have a 'Delete' button next to their details.

## Add User:

- Provide a form to add a new user with fields for Name, Email, and
Phone number.
- Validate that all fields are filled before submitting.
- Once a user is added, they should appear in the user list without
needing to refresh the page.

## Error Handling:

- Display user-friendly error messages if the API calls fail.

## Bonus Tasks:

- Consider possible performance optimizations.
- Add a search bar to filter through the user list based on their names.

## Submission:

Please submit a link to a GitHub repository.
